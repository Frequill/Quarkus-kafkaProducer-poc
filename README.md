A proof of concept of a "producer" application for kafka built with Quarkus. This program acts as a frontend and is made to send user requests to a backend application where all inter-program communication is done through KAFKA. 

This project can easily be made into a docker image and run inside a kafka cluster using docker compose.  One simply has to follow the description inside "Dockerfile.jvm"
